    <h1>Paper Boat and Forest Essentials</h1>
    <p>Design and branding in India have changed from being maximalist, attention-grabbing to minimalist without losing its roots or aesthetic. Two brands, who are from different strata economically, that embody this shift are Paper Boat and Forest Essentials. Paper Boat products are extremely affordable. They tell a story before the product hits your tongue. Designed by Elephant Design, the shape of the pouch, illustration style and minimal use of colour evoke childhood nostalgia and cultural authenticity. Its spirit is Indian, but the aesthetic is global.

      Forest Essentials is a luxury self-care brand. It’s branding and packaging speaks of just that while being rooted in the Indian design language. It draws from Ayurvedic principles and traditional motifs while being clean, minimal and purposeful. Hand painted illustrations, typography and jewel-toned accents give the sense of quiet luxury. It doesn’t overwhelm the consumer but invites them – a change from selling to storytelling.

      Both these brands reflect a deeper cultural shift: an India that doesn’t shout tradition but expresses it with elegance, restraint and purpose. In a market that is often full of colour and noise, these products cut that out and offer solace. They represent the new direction in design and branding, one that protects the Indian heritage while bringing in change with emotionally intelligent experience.</p>
