    <h1>The Newage India</h1>
    <p>As India dives into a global world, its cultural identity is being reshaped and reinvented with intention. The article talks about modernisation in India and how it is about balance – adapting technologies and modern lifestyles while safe keeping traditions, values and crafts. From design to festivals, and from families to languages, there is a vigilant effort to preserve what India is made of at its core. India is embracing modernity instead of resisting it further creating a hybrid culture where the new can co-exist with the old – subtly asserting acceptance and preservation.

      My research talks about the coexistence of two design thought processes with India’s multi-faceted culture. It sheds light on the fact that Indian graphic design cannot be just about a singular aesthetic but shows the country’s diverse history, culture and traditions. Minimal and maximal elements have forever coexisted which can be seen from ancient scripts to contemporary textiles. This showcases India’s adaptability to innovation while still being rooted in its heritage. By embracing both design approaches, Indian graphic design continues to evolve, offering a nuanced narrative that honours tradition while engaging with modernity.  </p>
